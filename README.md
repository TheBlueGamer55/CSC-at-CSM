# CSC-at-CSM
The Computer Science Club at the College of San Mateo website is a collaborative website built by the members of the club. It will contain our upcoming events and pictures of the events we've had, links to projects that we've created and worked on, and all the members of the club.

# Contributing
To help contribute to the website, please follow [these steps](CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Remember To Have Fun!
The club has a wide range of skill sets ranging from beginner to expert. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask. If you have any ideas, do not hesitate to tell us. Some of us will not know `Node.js` or `MongoDB` as much as someone else does. Some of us will not know as much `CSS` or `HTML` as someone else, but we are all here to help and learn from each other. Do not be afraid to contribute! Have fun and happy coding!
